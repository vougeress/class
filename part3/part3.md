# PMLDL. Lab 04. Part 3. Self-practice

## Task
Add the content of Lab 3 to this folder: `app.py`, `streamlit_app.py`, `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`. The repository also should contain a training script on Iris dataset. The script should outputs the model which can be tested in the workflow.

Your task is pretty much the same as in Parts 1,2, but here we ask you to include training in the workflow. The workflow should be activated once the training script is changed. Try to test LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier and SVC. You should get the reports not locally, but via GitHub Actions.
